This repository is to display the source code to the pizza orders app

Wanting to stretch and challenge my coding abilities and understanding, I registered for the CSE 320 Mobile Programming class in the second semester of my degree. I found the class to be very challenging since most prerequisites had been waived for me and at the time I struggled to understand anything more than procedural programming. In addition, the course was completely self-taught. The thought that I had bit off more than I could chew remained present in my mind and I considered withdrawing from the class several times throughout the semester, but reminding myself that my character was not one to quit I pressed forward in the class and did the work required to earn an A. 
This pizza orders app is proof that I know how to learn what I do not know, that I produce results, that I obtain objectives, and that I am not a quitter.
